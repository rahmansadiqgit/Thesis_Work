3️⃣ Managing Notebooks Effectively

Always start with data loading & preprocessing in separate scripts (scripts/preprocessing.py)
→ Notebooks just call these scripts/functions:

from scripts.preprocessing import clean_data

df = clean_data(data/raw/my_dataset.csv)


Use versioned notebooks:
Name them with numbers 01_, 02_, … so the workflow is clear.

Keep outputs reproducible:

Avoid saving large outputs in notebooks; save results to data/processed or models/.

Document steps:

Markdown cells for purpose, methods, and observations.

Code cells should be clean and modular (call scripts/functions, don’t copy-paste everything).
