1️⃣ Data Cleaning / Preprocessing Notebooks

Purpose: Load raw data, clean it, and create processed datasets.

Key points:

Use functions from scripts/preprocessing.py instead of writing all code in notebook.

Save cleaned/processed datasets to data/processed/.

Keep Markdown explanations for what cleaning steps were done.

Example filename: 01_data_cleaning.ipynb

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Notebooks

Purpose: Understand data distributions, patterns, correlations, missing values, and generate visualizations.

Key points:

Read processed data from data/processed/.

Focus on charts, plots, and insights rather than data cleaning.

Markdown cells explain observations and insights.

Example filename: 02_exploratory_analysis.ipynb

3️⃣ Model Training / Experiments Notebooks

Purpose: Build, train, and evaluate machine learning or deep learning models.

Key points:

Use processed data, never raw data.

Save trained models to models/ folder.

Document experiment settings, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics in Markdown.

Example filename: 03_model_training.ipynb

4️⃣ Visualization / Reporting Notebooks

Purpose: Summarize results and communicate findings.

Key points:

Pull results from processed data or trained models.

Generate plots, tables, and reports.

Can be used for sharing insights with non-technical stakeholders.

Example filename: 04_results_visualization.ipynb

5️⃣ Utility / Quick Experiments Notebooks

Purpose: Try out small snippets, test new libraries, or debug code.

Key points:

Usually temporary and not part of main workflow.

Can later be converted into scripts if the code becomes reusable.

General Notebook Management Tips

One notebook per logical task or experiment.

Avoid storing large data or models inside notebooks.

Always document steps and insights in Markdown.

Use version control:

Commit .ipynb files.

Use nbdime to better diff notebook changes Intruductions.txt
